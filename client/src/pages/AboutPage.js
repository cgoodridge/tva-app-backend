                Countless timelines battled one another for dominance across the Multiverse in a cataclysmic war that lasted for eons and nearly resulted in the absolute destruction of existence. 
                To prevent this, the Time-Keepers brought peace and order to the Multiverse by arranging the timelines into a single "Sacred Timeline". 
                In order to preserve the timeline's proper flow, the Time-Keepers then created the Time Variance Authority to police the Multiverse from Variants who create nexus events by stepping off of the path that the Time-Keepers created. 
                If nexus events are left unchecked, the timeline could branch off and lead to another multiversal war.
